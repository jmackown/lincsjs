It seems that I am some kind of a galactic yo-yo! An unintelligent enemy is far less dangerous than an intelligent one…. No… No-no-no-no-wait-wait-wait-wait… I remember I'm-I-I… I'm with my father, we're lying back in the grass, it's a warm Gallifreyan night— I think I might have miscalculated. There are worlds out there where the sky is burning, and the sea's asleep, and the rivers dream; people made of smoke and cities made of song. Somewhere there's danger, somewhere there's injustice, and somewhere else the tea's getting cold. Come on, Ace. We've got work to do.</p>\n<p>A little gratitude wouldn't irretrievably damage my ego. Alright? Of course I'm alright, my child. You know, I am so constantly outwitting the opposition, I tend to forget the delights and satisfaction of the gentle art of fisticuffs. There are fixed points throughout time where things must stay exactly the way they are. This is not one of them. This is an opportunity! Whatever happens here will create its own timeline, its own reality, a temporal tipping point. The future revolves around you, here, now, so do good!</p>\n<p>Can I talk about planets now? Ricky, if I was to tell you what I was doing to the controls of my frankly magnificent timeship, would you even begin to understand? It's times like this I wish I still had my scarf. It may be irrational of me, but human beings are my favorite species. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Your ideas are too narrow and crippled. I am a citizen of the universe and a gentleman to boot. I don't suppose we'll ever know if we actually succeeded. But at worst, we failed doing the right thing, as opposed to succeeding in doing the wrong.</p>\n<p>Courage isn’t a matter of not being frightened, it’s being afraid and doing what you have to do anyway. I can't stand burnt toast. I loathe bus stations. Terrible places. Full of lost luggage and lost souls. Mmmm… what's that m'boy? I think I might have miscalculated. No, not the hugging. I'm against the hugging. Well, I'll tell you something that should be of vital interest to you.…That you, Sir, are a NITWIT! Be a pal and tell me, Am I a good man? Are you listening to me? Doctor no more. Blimey, trying to make an Ood laugh...</p>\n<p>Not allowed? Not allowed? Me, I’m allowed everywhere. I'm half human. On my mother's side. Right! So stop dilly-dallying, and cross it! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Blimey, trying to make an Ood laugh... If I grow to be half the man that you are, Clara Oswald, then I shall be happy indeed. I once spent a hell of a long time trying to get a gobby Australian to Heathrow airport. This stuff, or whoever sent it, is cleverer than we are. Unfortunate, isn't it? Frightened people. Give me a Dalek any day.</p>\n<p>Death is always more frightening when it strikes invisibly. Excellent. Blow up that vehicle. No. That is not the question. That is not where we start. I am totally against bantering. Don't you think she looks tired? The past is another country. 1987's just the Isle of Wight. Your ideas are too narrow and crippled. I am a citizen of the universe and a gentleman to boot. Soon, I expect. Or later. One of those. I had to face my fear...that was more important than just going on living.... Why can't you leave me alone?!</p>\n<p>River, you know my name. You whispered my name in my ear! There's only one reason I would ever tell anyone my name. There's only one time I could... I once spent a hell of a long time trying to get a gobby Australian to Heathrow airport. You don't understand so you find excuses. Thank you, Strax. And if I'm ever in need of advice from a psychotic potato dwarf, you'll certainly be the first to know. New-new-Doctor. It's rather a pity, in a way...now the universe is down to 699 wonders. Yes, well, the definition of the word 'humanity' is always a rather complex question, isn’t it?</p>\n<p>Jamie, remind me to give you a lesson in tying knots, sometime. You’ll never understand. I want to see the universe, not to rule it. Brave heart, Tegan. Our lives are different from anybody else’s. That’s the exciting thing. Nobody in the universe can do what we’re doing. One day, I shall come back. Yes, I shall come back. Until then, there must be no regrets, no tears, no anxieties. Just go forward in all your beliefs and prove to me that I am not mistaken in mine. Goodbye Susan. Goodbye my dear.</p>\n<p>The Doctor. Nosey parker. The world's about to end, and here I am, stuck in traffic. When I say run, run. ...RUN! Renewed? Have I? That's it, I've been renewed. It's part of the TARDIS. Without it I couldn't survive. I might've been saying something important. I was saying something important! Reverse the polarity of the neutron flow. Don't you think she looks tired? Goodbye...my Sarah Jane! Oh, my giddy aunt! You don't understand so you find excuses. Sorry, I'm going to have to relieve you of your pet. Shut up, I was talking to the horse.</p>"}}}},pathContext:{slug:"/second-post"}}}});

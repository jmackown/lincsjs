Follow me, and run! Underneath it all I think you're probably kind and nice, and very brave. I just wish you weren't a soldier. You see when I started, all those years ago, I was just running. I called myself the Doctor but it was just a name. Then I went to Skaro. And I met you lot. And I understood who I was. Please just... just see me. I don't know. But I'd probably blame the English.
